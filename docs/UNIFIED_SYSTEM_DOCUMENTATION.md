## 🔄 Data Integration

All components share common data structures:

### Warehouse Mappings
```json
{
  "warehouse_mappings": [
    {
      "veeqo_warehouse_id": 12345,
      "easyship_address_id": "addr_abc123",
      "original_name": "Las Vegas Warehouse"
    }
  ],
  "sync_summary": {
    "successful_syncs": 25,
    "success_rate_percent": 96.2
  }
}
```

### API Configuration
- **Veeqo API**: Warehouse and order management
- **Easyship API**: Shipping and address validation
- Shared API keys across all components
- Consistent error handling and retry logic

## 🎯 Routing Logic Integration

The system implements intelligent carrier routing:

### Nevada (NV) International Orders
- **Platform**: Easyship
- **Carrier**: FedEx International Priority
- **Warehouse**: Las Vegas locations preferred
- **Service**: DDP (Delivered Duty Paid)

### Other Domestic/International Orders
- **Platform**: Veeqo
- **Carriers**: USPS, DHL, UPS based on value/weight
- **Warehouses**: Geographic optimization
- **Service**: Appropriate service level selection

## 📊 Unified Features

### Dashboard & Monitoring
- Real-time warehouse status
- Sync progress tracking
- Order processing metrics
- System health indicators

### Warehouse Management
- Bulk synchronization operations
- Address validation workflows
- Mapping management
- Status monitoring

### Order Processing
- Smart routing with geographic optimization
- Multiple input methods (GUI, paste, web)
- Validation and preview capabilities
- Integration with both platforms

### Reporting & Analytics
- Excel generation with multiple sheets
- Order analysis by country/customer
- Routing performance metrics
- Sync status reports

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start (Recommended)
1. Run `python integration_launcher.py`
2. Click "🏭 Unified System (Recommended)"
3. Start with the Dashboard tab for system overview
4. Use Warehouses tab for initial setup
5. Test routing with sample orders

### Alternative Approaches
- **Desktop Focus**: Launch Advanced Warehouse GUI
- **Web Access**: Start Web Interface (opens browser automatically)
- **Routing Testing**: Use Enhanced Routing GUI for detailed testing
- **Reporting**: Excel Report Generator for data analysis

## 🔧 Configuration

### API Setup
All components use the same API configuration:
```python
VEEQO_API_KEY = "Vqt/2d967ce051cfc67054fa4cf14d9f24e7"
EASYSHIP_API_KEY = "prod_VC6QKi48mtqwXpXJubfmT/MsOmzTIG0Qyd89/X61ylc="
```

### Data Files
- `warehouse_mapping_20250721_004159.json` - Primary mapping file
- `processed_orders_*.json` - Order data for reports
- System automatically creates and updates these files

## 🔄 Workflow Integration

### Typical Workflow
1. **System Check**: Use Dashboard to verify system status
2. **Warehouse Sync**: Ensure all warehouses are synchronized
3. **Order Testing**: Test routing logic with sample customers
4. **Order Processing**: Create orders with automatic routing
5. **Monitoring**: Track sync status and system health
6. **Reporting**: Generate Excel reports for analysis

### Cross-Component Usage
- Start Unified System for general management
- Switch to Enhanced Routing for complex routing tests
- Use Web Interface for remote access
- Generate reports using Excel tool
- All data remains synchronized across components
