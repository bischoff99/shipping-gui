# Quick Public Access with Ngrok (No GitHub Required!)

## What is Ngrok?
Ngrok creates a secure tunnel from the internet to your locally running app. Perfect for:
- Testing with others
- Temporary public access
- No deployment needed

## Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Download Ngrok
1. Visit: https://ngrok.com/download
2. Download for Windows
3. Extract the zip file

### Step 2: Sign Up (Free)
1. Create free account at https://ngrok.com/signup
2. Get your auth token from dashboard

### Step 3: Setup Ngrok
```bash
# In the folder where you extracted ngrok:
ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
```

### Step 4: Make Your App Public
```bash
# Your Flask app is already running on port 5000
# In a new terminal, run:
ngrok http 5000
```

### Step 5: Get Your Public URL
Ngrok will show:
```
Forwarding: https://abc123xyz.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:5000
```

That's your public URL! Share it with anyone.

## Advantages:
- ✅ Works immediately
- ✅ No GitHub needed
- ✅ No deployment process
- ✅ Free tier available
- ✅ HTTPS included

## Limitations:
- URL changes each time (unless paid)
- Needs your computer running
- Free tier has request limits

## Alternative: Localtunnel (Even Simpler)

```bash
# Install
npm install -g localtunnel

# Run (your app already running on 5000)
lt --port 5000

# Get URL like: https://gentle-panda-42.loca.lt
```

## For Permanent Solution:
Consider creating a new GitHub account or using GitLab/Bitbucket for proper deployment later.
