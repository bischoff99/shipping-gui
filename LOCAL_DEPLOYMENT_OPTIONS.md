# Deployment Options with Limited GitHub Access

## Option 1: Deploy Using Docker Locally

Since your app is already running locally, you can:

### A. Use Docker Desktop
1. Install Docker Desktop for Windows
2. Build your container:
   ```bash
   docker build -t shipping-gui .
   ```
3. Run it locally:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 5000:5000 -e VEEQO_API_KEY=Vqt/7a55360df188537a330a977ef0034942 -e EASYSHIP_API_KEY=prod_VC6QKi48mtqwXpXJubfmT/MsOmzTIG0Qyd89/X61ylc= -e SECRET_KEY=unified_order_system_2025_production_secret_key_v2 shipping-gui
   ```

### B. Use ngrok for Public Access
1. Download ngrok from https://ngrok.com
2. Run your Flask app (already running)
3. In another terminal:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 5000
   ```
4. You'll get a public URL like: `https://abc123.ngrok.io`

## Option 2: Alternative Git Hosting

### Use GitLab Instead
1. Create account at https://gitlab.com
2. Create new project
3. Push your code:
   ```bash
   git remote add gitlab https://gitlab.com/YOUR_USERNAME/shipping-gui.git
   git push gitlab main
   ```

### Use Bitbucket
1. Create account at https://bitbucket.org
2. Similar process as GitLab

## Option 3: Direct File Upload Deployment

### Render.com (Supports Direct Upload)
1. Go to https://render.com
2. Sign up (no GitHub required)
3. Create "Web Service"
4. Choose "Docker" deployment
5. Upload your project as ZIP

### Replit
1. Go to https://replit.com
2. Create new Repl
3. Upload your files directly
4. Run the app

## Option 4: Keep Running Locally

Your app is already running at http://127.0.0.1:5000

To make it accessible:
1. Configure your router for port forwarding
2. Use a service like ngrok (mentioned above)
3. Use localtunnel:
   ```bash
   npm install -g localtunnel
   lt --port 5000
   ```

## Option 5: Create New GitHub Account

If the issue is with your current GitHub account:
1. Create a new free GitHub account
2. Create the repository there
3. Push your code to the new account
4. Deploy via Railway/Heroku/Vercel
