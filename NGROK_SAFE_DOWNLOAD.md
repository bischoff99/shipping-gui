# Safe Ngrok Download Guide

## Windows Defender Blocked the Download

This is a false positive - ngrok is a legitimate tool used by millions of developers. Here's how to get it safely:

## Option 1: Download from Official Website (Recommended)

1. Go to: https://ngrok.com/download
2. Click "Download for Windows"
3. If Windows Defender blocks it:
   - Click "More info" 
   - Click "Run anyway"
   - Or temporarily disable Windows Defender Real-time protection

## Option 2: Use Chocolatey Package Manager

If you have Chocolatey installed:
```powershell
choco install ngrok
```

## Option 3: Use the Windows Defender Exception

1. Open Windows Security
2. Go to "Virus & threat protection"
3. Click "Manage settings" under "Virus & threat protection settings"
4. Scroll to "Exclusions" and click "Add or remove exclusions"
5. Add folder: `C:\ngrok`
6. Try downloading again

## Option 4: Alternative - Use Cloudflare Tunnel (Cloudflared)

Similar to ngrok but might not be blocked:
1. Download from: https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases
2. Run: `cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:5001`

## Option 5: Use LocalTunnel (via npm)

If you have Node.js installed:
```bash
npm install -g localtunnel
lt --port 5001
```

## Quick Solution - Manual Download Steps:

1. **Open Edge/Chrome in InPrivate/Incognito mode**
2. **Go to**: https://ngrok.com/download
3. **Right-click** the Windows download link
4. **Save as** to your Downloads folder
5. **Extract manually** to C:\ngrok

## After Successful Download:

1. Extract ngrok.exe to a folder
2. Open PowerShell in that folder
3. Run:
   ```powershell
   .\ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_TOKEN
   .\ngrok http 5001
   ```

## Why This Happens:

- Ngrok creates network tunnels which can trigger security software
- It's a legitimate tool but uses techniques similar to some malware
- This is why it's sometimes flagged as a false positive

The tool is safe when downloaded from the official source!
