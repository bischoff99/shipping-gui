# Immediate Deployment Solutions

Since ngrok is blocked by Windows Defender and you need deployment now, here are your best options:

## Option 1: Override Windows Defender (Fastest)

1. **Windows Security Settings**:
   - Press `Windows + I`
   - Go to "Update & Security" → "Windows Security"
   - Click "Virus & threat protection"
   - Click "Manage settings"
   - **Temporarily turn OFF "Real-time protection"**
   - Download ngrok again
   - **Turn protection back ON after download**

2. **Direct Browser Download**:
   - Go to: https://bin.equinox.io/c/bNyj1mQVY4c/ngrok-v3-stable-windows-amd64.zip
   - When blocked, click "Keep" or "More info" → "Keep anyway"

## Option 2: Use GitHub Codespaces (Free Cloud IDE)

Since you have a GitHub account:
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/bischoff99/shipping-gui
2. Click the green "Code" button
3. Click "Codespaces" tab
4. Click "Create codespace on main"
5. Your app will run in the cloud with a public URL!

## Option 3: Railway Direct Upload (No Git Required)

1. Export your project as ZIP:
   - Select all files except `.git`, `__pycache__`, `.env`
   - Right-click → "Send to" → "Compressed folder"

2. Deploy on Railway:
   - Go to https://railway.app
   - New Project → "Deploy a Docker Image"
   - Upload your ZIP file
   - Add environment variables

## Option 4: Use Your Docker Image

Since you already have a working Docker image:

### Push to Docker Hub:
```powershell
# Create Docker Hub account at https://hub.docker.com
# Then:
docker login
docker tag shipping-gui YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME/shipping-gui
docker push YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME/shipping-gui
```

### Deploy anywhere that supports Docker:
- Google Cloud Run
- Azure Container Instances  
- AWS App Runner
- DigitalOcean App Platform

## Option 5: Port Forwarding (If you control your router)

1. Access your router (usually 192.168.1.1)
2. Find "Port Forwarding" section
3. Forward external port 80 to internal 192.168.x.x:5001
4. Use your public IP: http://your-public-ip

## Recommended: Quick GitHub Codespaces

This is the fastest way without any downloads:
1. Your code is already on GitHub
2. Codespaces gives you a public URL instantly
3. 60 hours free per month
4. No Windows Defender issues!
